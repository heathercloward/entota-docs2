# Sponsors

You can add sponsors to assets to help in getting the asset business
ready. Sponsors can provide feedback and endorse an asset or contest an
asset. While all users can contest an asset, only a sponsor can move an
asset from Candidate status to Review status and finally to an Accepted
status.
