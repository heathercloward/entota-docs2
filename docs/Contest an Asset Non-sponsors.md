# Contest an Asset (Non-sponsors)

You can contest an asset whether or not you are a sponsor of the asset.
If an Accepted asset is contested, it is moved back to Candidate status
and must be re-endorsed by the asset's sponsors. All Sponsors and
Assignees are notified by email, depending on their user settings, when
the asset is contested. Refer to [Sponsor an
Asset](Sponsor%20an%20Asset.md) for more information.

To contest an asset:

1.  Click the drop-down menu for the asset.
