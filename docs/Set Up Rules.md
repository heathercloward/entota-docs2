# Set Up Rules

Business Rules can define controls for business data to help businesses
achieve goals. Rule compliance is assessed based on a true or false
analysis. If the rule statement is true, the rule is achieved. If the
statement is false, it is not achieved.

Rules are assigned to [Policies](Set%20Up%20Policies.md).

As you are setting up a rule, you can click the Guidance
(![](Resources/Images/Guidance%20Icon.png)) icon to open the Guidance
panel to view assistance. Refer to [Guidance](Guidance.md) for more
information.

>**NOTE:** If a user does not have permission to add an asset, it
displays dimmed with a lock icon on the Quick Add menu.

To add a rule:

1.  Click the plus sign (Add) icon on the Home page.

2.  Select **Rule** from the drop-down.

3.  Enter the **Rule Statement**.

4.  Enter **Implication**.
    
    >**NOTE:** The Implication is the effect a policy or action has on
    the operations or financial well-being of a company.

5.  Select an assignee for the rule in the **Assigned To** field.
    
    >**NOTE:** When you assign a person to an asset, the assignee
    receives a notification by email, depending on their user settings.

6.  Click **Save**.

On the rule’s detail page, you can also do the following:

  - If the rule is in Review or Accepted status, and you are not a
    sponsor of the rule you can be an additional endorser of the rule by
    clicking the Add Your Endorsement icon. Your name is added to the
    Additional Endorsers list.
    
    >**NOTE:** Alternatively, you can contest a rule. Refer to [Contest a
    rule](Contest%20an%20Asset%20Non-sponsors.md) for more information.
    Refer to [Sponsor an Asset](Sponsor%20an%20Asset.md) for details
    about the asset endorsement process such as how it affects the
    asset’s status.
