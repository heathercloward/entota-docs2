# Publish Governance Elements

Business processes built and published in the Entota™ can be imported
into dspConduct™ to create an on premises instance of these elements. On
import, the category, business process, scenario, role, and task records
are registered in dspConduct™.

After a business process is published in Entota™, it is imported into
dspConduct™ via a service page that runs every 30 minutes.

Refer to Import Entota™ Governance Elements into dspConduct™ in the DSP®
online help for more information.
